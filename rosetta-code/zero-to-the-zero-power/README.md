## Description
Some computer programming languages are not exactly consistent (with other computer programming languages) when raising zero to the zeroth power: 0^0

## Task
Show the results of raising zero to the zeroth power.

If your computer language objects to 0**0 or 0^0 at compile time, you may also try something like

```
	x = 0
	y = 0
	z = x**y
	say 'z=' z
```

## Show the result here.
And of course use any symbols or notation that is supported in your computer programming language for exponentiation.
